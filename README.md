# Decision-Tree-Classification-in-R
The Decision tree classification is used to classify the various categories of data by using splits. The splits are based on the conditions which are represented in the form of a tree. The splits are called the leaves and the model uses the rpart library is used to build the classifier and plotted.
Decision Tree algorithm belongs to the family of supervised learning algorithms. Unlike other supervised learning algorithms, the decision tree algorithm can be used for solving regression and classification problems too.
The goal of using a Decision Tree is to create a training model that can use to predict the class or value of the target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from prior data(training data).
In Decision Trees, for predicting a class label for a record we start from the root of the tree. We compare the values of the root attribute with the recordâ€™s attribute. On the basis of comparison, we follow the branch corresponding to that value and jump to the next node.
